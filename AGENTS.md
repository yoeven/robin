# Instructions for AI coding agents

Use this file when adding Robin to **another** repository.

## Required workflow reference

Default (latest):

```yaml
uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
```

Pinned release (preferred for stability):

```yaml
uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@v2
```

For a direct action step: `antongulin/robin@main` or `@v2`.

## Do not use

- `@v0`, `v0`, or any `v0` release tag — workflows fail or point at stale code.
- `pull_request_target` — not supported; security risk with secrets.

## Required secrets (in the consumer repo)

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Provider API key |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Model id |

Free OpenRouter example:

- `LLM_BASE_URL`: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- `LLM_MODEL`: `openrouter/free`

## Minimal consumer workflow

Create `.github/workflows/robin.yml`:

```yaml
name: Robin

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

## Permissions

The job needs:

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

`actions/checkout` is optional for review-only workflows.

## Maintainers: release-notes upkeep (automatic)

Everything above is for adding Robin to a consumer repo. This section is for agents
working **in this repository**: whenever a release lands (release-please auto-merges
`chore: release X.Y.Z` and publishes the GitHub release), clean up its notes as part of
the same task — do it automatically, without asking.

1. Inspect every release cut during the session: `gh release view <tag> --json body`.
2. Enrich each `feat`/`fix` entry with a one-line plain-language user impact, and credit
   external contributors (`— thanks [@login](https://github.com/login)!`).
3. Catch orphaned commits: a commit that lands on `main` between the release PR's
   snapshot and its merge appears in **no** changelog. Compare
   `git log <prev-tag>..<tag> --oneline` against the notes and add missing entries under
   the matching section.
4. Edit **only** the GitHub release (`gh release edit <tag> --notes '…'`). Never rewrite
   `CHANGELOG.md` retroactively — a changelog commit itself triggers another release.
5. Keep the generated format (version heading with compare link, `### Features` /
   `### Bug Fixes` / `### Documentation` sections). Never create tags or releases by
   hand, and never delete a published release.

# Robin

Free AI code reviews for every pull request. You bring an API key; Robin reviews show up like a teammate left comments.

![A Robin review on a pull request — summary, severity-tiered findings, and a teammate-style note](docs/assets/robin-review.png)

## What you get

- A review when you open a pull request (or when someone comments `/robin`)
- A short summary plus inline comments on changed lines, with one-click suggested fixes when the model can pin one down
- Reviews that check the rest of your repo (callers, definitions) when your model supports tool calling
- Your choice of AI provider — including **free** options

When there's nothing worth flagging, Robin says so instead of inventing nitpicks:

![A clean Robin pass on a pull request — no issues found](docs/assets/robin-review-clean.png)

You are **not** signing up for a separate review bot service. The workflow runs in your repo and calls the AI URL you configure.

## For AI coding agents

Using Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, or similar? Copy this prompt after secrets are set:

```text
Add Robin to this repository.
- Workflow file: .github/workflows/robin.yml
- Reusable workflow: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
- Action ref if needed: antongulin/robin@main
- Secrets: LLM_API_KEY, LLM_BASE_URL, LLM_MODEL
- Do NOT use @v0 or any v0 tag
- Do NOT use pull_request_target
Read AGENTS.md in the robin repo for full rules.
```

## Quick install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the installer from the root of the Git repository you want Robin to review — not
> from your home directory. The workflow and secrets are configured once per repository;
> the companion agent skill is installed globally once per machine.

From the target repository, run either:

```bash
npx robin-review
```

or, without Node.js:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://robinreview.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Either one keeps a single canonical `.github/workflows/robin.yml` and installs or updates
the [companion chat skill](#robin-in-your-editor) in your coding agents. If it finds an
older Robin or Universal Code Reviewer workflow under another name, it moves that file to
`.github/robin-workflow-archive/` (where GitHub cannot trigger it) before creating the
canonical workflow. Inspect the archived copy, then remove it after confirming the
migration. An unrelated file already using the canonical path is never overwritten.
Run an installer separately in every repository that should use Robin. Re-running it is
safe and idempotent — your pinned version and any `with:` overrides (for example
`llm-temperature`) are preserved.
You still need to add the three secrets — do **Steps 1 and 2** below, then commit and push.
You can **skip Step 3**: the installer already did it.

**Auto-updates:** the generated workflow references
`antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main`, so every
review runs the latest Robin automatically — nothing to bump or re-install. Prefer fixed
versions? Pin a tag with `ROBIN_REF=v2 npx robin-review` (see [Version pins](#version-pins)).

Prefer to do it by hand, or read the installer first? It's
[bin/robin-review.js](bin/robin-review.js) (npm) / [scripts/install.sh](scripts/install.sh)
(curl) — or follow the manual 3 steps instead.

## Setup in 3 steps

### Step 1 — Get an API key (free option)

The easiest free setup uses [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/):

1. Create an account at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).
2. Create an API key in the dashboard.
3. Use these values for your GitHub secrets:

| Secret name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Your OpenRouter key (`sk-or-...`) |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| `LLM_MODEL` | `openrouter/free` |

> [!TIP]
> `openrouter/free` picks a free model for each review — **$0 from OpenRouter**. OpenRouter rotates which model runs; **leave this secret as `openrouter/free`** — the action retries and uses provider fallbacks when a route is temporarily unavailable. You only spend [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions) minutes while the job runs (often a few minutes per review).
>
> GitHub Free includes about **2,000 Actions minutes/month** (public and private repos); [GitHub Pro](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions) includes about **3,000 minutes/month** (check your plan for current limits). Reviews usually take a few minutes each.

Other providers (OpenAI, Groq, Ollama, etc.) work too. See [Supported providers](#supported-providers) or [docs/ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md).

### Step 2 — Add secrets on GitHub

1. Open **your** repository on GitHub (not this one).
2. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret** and add each name from the table above.

> [!WARNING]
> Never put API keys inside workflow files, pull request comments, or chat with an AI. Only use GitHub Secrets.

### Step 3 — Add the workflow file

> [!NOTE]
> **Ran the Quick install one-liner above?** Skip this step — the script already created
> this file. Just finish Steps 1 and 2 (the secrets), then commit and push.

Create a new file in your repo:

**Path:** `.github/workflows/robin.yml`

**Contents:** copy this exactly:

```yaml
name: Robin

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

Commit and push. Open a pull request — you should see a review within a few minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use **`@main`** for the latest fixes, or pin a release tag (for example `@v2` or `@v2.7.0`) from [releases](https://github.com/antongulin/robin/releases). Do **not** use `@v0`. See [Version pins](#version-pins) below.

## Running on a self-hosted runner

By default, the reusable workflow runs on GitHub's hosted `ubuntu-latest` runner:

```yaml
with:
  runner: '"ubuntu-latest"'
```

To run reviews on your own machine, Mac mini, home server, local Linux box, or Coolify runner, pass `runner` as valid JSON. Use a JSON string for one label or a JSON array for multiple labels.

To create a local runner, go to:

```text
Repository Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New self-hosted runner
```

Then add labels such as `local`, `linux`, `mac`, or `coolify`, and reference those labels through the `runner` input.

### Does the runner need to run all the time?

A matching self-hosted runner must be online when GitHub starts the review job. It can be a local runner process (`./run.sh`), a service (`./svc.sh start`), a Docker container, or a Coolify-managed service. Docker is optional; it is just one way to run the GitHub Actions runner.

If no matching runner is online, GitHub queues the job until one comes online. It will not fall back to `ubuntu-latest` unless you add a separate fallback job. For reliable PR reviews, keep an always-on runner available, such as a Mac mini, home server, VPS, or Coolify service. A laptop runner only works while the laptop is awake and the runner process or service is running.

> [!WARNING]
> Self-hosted runners can execute arbitrary workflow code.
> Do not use them for untrusted public pull requests.
> Prefer repo-owned private repos or trusted collaborators only.
> Consider ephemeral runners for stronger isolation.

Local machine runner:

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      runner: '["self-hosted", "local"]'
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

Coolify runner:

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      runner: '["self-hosted", "linux", "coolify"]'
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

## Using it day to day

| When | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| You open a PR | Review runs once automatically |
| You push more commits | No new review (saves time and API usage) |
| You want another review | Comment `/robin` on the PR (first line of the comment) |
| You want a short overview only | Comment `/summary` |
| You need help | Comment `/help` |

`/review` still works as an alias for `/robin`. Only people with **write** access (or higher) on the repo can run these commands by default.

## Example

The bot posts a status comment, then a review with severity counts:

```md
## 🏹 Robin

🚨 **1 High** | ⚠️ **1 Medium** | 💡 **2 Suggestions**

### Summary
Focused change. Main risk: timeout errors are not handled clearly.

### Findings Not Posted Inline
**1 (`src/example.ts:24`)** — Retries exist but timeout failures lack context.
```

## Agent mode: reviews with repository context

Robin doesn't only look at the diff. When your model supports tool calling, the review is a
short multi-turn investigation: the model can read full files, grep for callers of a changed
function, and list directories at the PR's head commit before it decides what's a bug. Findings
can come with a one-click GitHub **suggested change** containing the exact fix.

- Nothing to set up: Robin downloads a read-only snapshot of the PR through the GitHub API (no checkout, and PR code is never run).
- If the model doesn't support tools (some free OpenRouter routes, many small Ollama models), Robin quietly falls back to the classic diff-only review.
- Turn it off with `agent-mode: off` in `.github/robin.yml`, or cap the investigation with `agent-max-turns` (default 40).
- Long investigations don't hit a wall: when the context fills up, Robin has the model summarize what it has found so far and keeps going, like Cursor's context compaction.

Details: [Agent mode](docs/ADVANCED.md#agent-mode-multi-turn-review-with-repository-context).

## Robin in your editor

The one-line installer also installs a small **companion skill** into every coding agent
on your machine (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, …) via the cross-platform
[skills CLI](https://skills.sh) —
`npx -y skills add https://github.com/antongulin/robin --skill robin --agent '*' --global --yes`. It
ships with Robin; there's nothing separate to sign up for. (Skip it with `ROBIN_SKILL=0`,
or install it by hand with that command.) Once installed, the skill activates for ordinary
pull-request work: the agent detects Robin on the base branch, so you do not need to ask
for Robin explicitly. Explicit requests still work too:

> "create a pull request" · "review this PR with Robin" · "fix the Robin feedback"

The agent drives a bounded review → verify → fix → reply → resolve → re-review loop. It
fixes only findings confirmed against the full repository and skips noise with a factual
reply. Five completed Robin reviews are approved by default; above five, the agent asks
for one additional review at a time unless you explicitly enabled full-auto review for
that PR. Merge is a separate permission and remains manual by default. After an authorized
merge, the agent verifies base-branch sync and task-branch cleanup. Release preparation is
never automatic; when the repository already publishes releases, the final report may
offer it as a separate next step. Source: [skills/robin/SKILL.md](skills/robin/SKILL.md).

## Supported providers

| Provider | `LLM_BASE_URL` | `LLM_MODEL` example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OpenRouter (free)** | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | `openrouter/free` |
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-5-mini`, `o4-mini` |
| Anthropic (Claude) | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1` | `claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| Groq | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| Ollama (your server) | `http://YOUR_SERVER:11434/v1` | `llama3.2` |

Anthropic works through its OpenAI-compatible endpoint with your regular Anthropic API key; pasting `https://api.anthropic.com` without `/v1` is fine too. OpenAI reasoning models (`o1`/`o3`/`o4-mini`, `gpt-5*`, `codex-*`) are sent without `temperature` and with `max_completion_tokens` automatically. See [Provider notes](docs/ADVANCED.md#provider-notes).

GitHub’s servers cannot reach `localhost` on your laptop. For Ollama at home, use a public server, a tunnel, or a [self-hosted runner](docs/ADVANCED.md#save-github-actions-minutes).

## Optional: config and custom rules

Copy [`.github/robin.yml.example`](.github/robin.yml.example) to `.github/robin.yml` to set `max-diff-size`, skip extra paths, and more. The same file is the normal place to change `reasoning-effort` for providers that expose reasoning controls; it defaults to `high`, and `off` sends no reasoning configuration. Details: [docs/ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md#repository-config-file) and [Reasoning effort](docs/ADVANCED.md#reasoning-effort-provider-dependent).

Add `.github/code-reviewer.md` in your repo:

```md
# Reviewer rules

- Focus on bugs and security, not formatting.
- Ask for tests when business logic changes.
```

## Something went wrong?

| Problem | What to try |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow fails immediately | Check all three secrets exist and the workflow uses `@main` |
| `Input required: model` or `llm-base-url` | Add missing secrets (Step 2) |
| Review never appears | Open **Actions** tab → open the failed run → read the error |
| `/robin` does nothing | Put `/robin` on the **first** line; you need write access on the repo. On `@v1`, pin `@v1.4.0`+ or use `/review` if the tag predates v1.4.0 |
| Review is very short | PR may be huge — see [docs/ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md) (`max-diff-size`) |
| `Empty response from LLM` | Free routers sometimes return no text — the action retries automatically; comment `/robin` again |
| `OpenRouter stall` / job runs 45 min with no review | Auto-router hung — action now aborts after 45s with no stream and retries | Watch Actions log for `LLM resolved model` (routing OK); pin `@v2` or `@main` for the fix |
| `404 Provider returned error` | Normal for `openrouter/free` when one provider is down — the action retries up to 5 times; keep `LLM_MODEL=openrouter/free` |
| `temperature` / `max_tokens` rejected by the model | The action warns, retries once without that parameter (or with `max_completion_tokens`), and keeps that shape for the run. To pin a value some models insist on (Kimi requires `1`), set `llm-temperature` in your workflow's `with:` block, see [docs/ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md#models-that-require-a-fixed-temperature) |
| `reasoning-effort` rejected as unsupported or invalid | The action warns, retries once with no reasoning override, and completes the review when that retry succeeds. If you set the value yourself, the final status comment tells you to update `reasoning-effort` in `.github/robin.yml` or the workflow `with:` block; a rejected `high` default only shows in the Actions log. Set `reasoning-effort: off` to stop sending it |

## Version pins

| Pin | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `@main` | Latest changes on the default branch |
| `@v2` | Latest `2.x` release (updated on each release) |
| `@v2.7.0` | Exact version (most predictable) |
| Full commit SHA | Maximum supply-chain safety |

```yaml
uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@v2
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antongulin/robin.git
cd robin
npm ci
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Runtime code lives in `dist/index.js`; run `npm run build` before releasing. A full build removes intermediate files under `dist/` after bundling so only `index.js` remains locally (same file CI checks against).

If you ran `tsc` alone and see extra files under `dist/`, run `npm run clean`.

# Advanced guide

This document is for maintainers and power users. For a short setup, see the [README](../README.md).

## Repository config file

Copy [`.github/robin.yml.example`](../.github/robin.yml.example) to `.github/robin.yml` on your default branch.

```yaml
max-diff-size: 25000
max-comments: 10
json-response-mode: true
request-changes: true
# reasoning-effort: high   # default; provider-dependent. Set "off" to send no reasoning configuration
# agent-mode: auto   # default; set off for single-shot diff review only
# agent-max-turns: 40
# agent-max-diff-size: 200000
skip-paths:
  - "**/generated/**"
```

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `max-diff-size` | Used when the workflow still passes the action default (`50000`) |
| `max-comments` | Used when the workflow still passes the action default (`15`) |
| `json-response-mode` | Used when `use-json-response-mode` is empty (action default defers to this file) |
| `request-changes` | Used when `request-changes` input is empty. `true` (default) blocks on high findings; `false` posts advisor-only comments |
| `reasoning-effort` | Used when the `reasoning-effort` action/workflow input is empty. Provider-dependent reasoning value; defaults to `high` when unset, `off` sends no reasoning configuration |
| `agent-mode` | Used when the `agent-mode` input is empty. `auto` (default) runs the [multi-turn agent review](#agent-mode-multi-turn-review-with-repository-context); `off` runs the single-shot diff review |
| `agent-max-turns` | Used when the `agent-max-turns` input is empty. Tool-calling turns before the final review is requested (default `40`, max `100`) |
| `agent-max-diff-size` | Used when the `agent-max-diff-size` input is empty. Diff characters sent up front in agent mode (default `200000`); `max-diff-size` still applies to the single-shot fallback |
| `skip-paths` | Extra paths removed from the diff before the LLM call |

Lockfiles (npm, yarn, pnpm, Cargo, Gemfile, poetry), `dist/`, `node_modules/`, and minified assets are always skipped automatically. If every changed file is skipped, the action posts a status comment and skips the LLM call.

The config file uses a small YAML subset (line-based keys only), not full YAML nesting.

## Pinning the action

| Ref | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `@main` | Latest changes on the default branch |
| `@v1` | Latest `1.x` release (floating tag, updated each release) |
| `@v1.2.3` | Exact semver from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/antongulin/robin/releases) |
| Full commit SHA | Maximum supply-chain safety in regulated environments |
| `@v0` | **Do not use** — outdated; workflows often fail |

```yaml
uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@v1
```

## Releases

Releases are automated with [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):

1. Conventional commits on `main` accumulate in a **Release** pull request (`chore: release X.Y.Z`).
2. Release PRs are verified, merged, and published automatically by the workflow.
3. The workflow updates `package.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, creates tag `vX.Y.Z`, and publishes [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/antongulin/robin/releases).
4. Floating tags `v1` and `v1.0` (major.minor) are updated so `@v1` stays current within the major version.

Maintainers: do not tag releases by hand unless the workflow failed; fix or rerun the workflow instead.

## Low-cost and free setups

### OpenRouter free router

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | OpenRouter API key |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| `LLM_MODEL` | `openrouter/free` |

Smaller diffs help free models stay fast and accurate:

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      max-diff-size: "25000"
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

### Save GitHub Actions minutes

- Keep the default flow: one review on PR open, then `/review` after fixes (do not enable `review-on-synchronize` unless you need it).
- Use a smaller `max-diff-size` for huge PRs.
- **Free tier:** GitHub Free includes about **2,000 Actions minutes/month** for public and private repos; GitHub Pro about **3,000 minutes/month** (limits can change — see [GitHub billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions) for your account).
- **Heavy usage:** use a [self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners) so LLM wait time does not consume hosted minutes.

To use a self-hosted runner with the reusable workflow, pass `runner` as valid JSON. A single label is a JSON string; multiple labels are a JSON array.

Coolify example:

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      runner: '["self-hosted", "linux", "coolify"]'
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

## All workflow inputs

Available on the [direct action](../action.yml) and the [reusable workflow](../.github/workflows/review.yml), unless noted. LLM credentials are action inputs / reusable-workflow secrets respectively.

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github-token` | `${{ github.token }}` | Token for PR API and comments (direct action only; reusable workflow uses `github.token`) |
| `llm-api-key` / `LLM_API_KEY` | `ollama` | Provider API key |
| `llm-base-url` / `LLM_BASE_URL` | — | OpenAI-compatible base URL (required) |
| `model` / `LLM_MODEL` | — | Model name (required) |
| `fail-on-high` | `false` | Fail the check if high-severity issues are found |
| `request-changes` | omit → `true` (defer to repo config) | `true` submits a blocking REQUEST_CHANGES review on high findings; `false` posts a non-blocking COMMENT (advisor mode). Reusable workflow input is a boolean with no default — omit it to let `.github/robin.yml` win |
| `max-diff-size` | `50000` | Max diff characters sent to the model |
| `max-output-tokens` | empty | Cap response tokens (optional) |
| `reasoning-effort` | empty (defer to repo config, then `high`) | Provider reasoning effort, provider-dependent (for example `low`, `medium`, `high`). Empty defers to `.github/robin.yml`; if that is also unset, `high` is sent. `off` sends no reasoning configuration |
| `llm-timeout-ms` | `600000` | LLM timeout (10 minutes) |
| `llm-temperature` | `0.1` | Sampling temperature (0–2). Raise only if your model rejects the default — some models accept a single fixed value (Kimi requires `1`) |
| `max-comments` | `15` | Max inline comments |
| `review-on-synchronize` | `false` | Review every new commit on the PR |
| `runner` | `'"ubuntu-latest"'` | Reusable workflow only: runner as a JSON string or JSON array |
| `min-command-permission` | `write` | Who can run `/review` |
| `review-instructions` | empty | Extra prompt text |
| `review-instructions-file` | `.github/code-reviewer.md` | Rules file on the base branch |
| `config-file` | `.github/robin.yml` | Repo config path on the base branch |
| `use-json-response-mode` | empty (defer to repo config, else true) | Request `response_format: json_object` when supported. Pass `"true"` / `"false"` on the reusable workflow |
| `agent-mode` | empty (defer to repo config, then `auto`) | `auto` lets the model read the repository with tools before reviewing, falling back to the single-shot diff review when the model has no tool support; `off` always uses the single-shot review |
| `agent-max-turns` | empty (defer to repo config, then `40`) | Maximum tool-calling turns in agent mode (capped at 100) |
| `agent-max-diff-size` | empty (defer to repo config, then `200000`) | Diff characters sent up front in agent mode. The model reads any truncated files with its tools; `max-diff-size` still applies to the single-shot fallback |

## Agent mode (multi-turn review with repository context)

By default (`agent-mode: auto`), `/review` is a multi-turn conversation instead of a
single request:

1. Robin downloads the PR head commit as a tarball through the GitHub API and unpacks it
   into the runner's temp directory. No `actions/checkout` step is needed, and the code is
   only read, never executed.
2. The model gets the line-numbered diff plus three read-only tools: `read_file`, `grep`,
   and `list_files`. It uses them to read full files, find callers of changed functions,
   and look up definitions before it decides something is a bug.
3. When it has enough context it returns the usual JSON review. Findings can include an
   exact replacement for the affected lines, which Robin posts as a one-click GitHub
   **suggested change** when every line in the range is in the same diff hunk.

The defaults favor finding bugs over saving tokens, sized for frontier models with
200k-token or larger context windows:

| Limit | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Tool-calling turns | 40 (`agent-max-turns`, max 100) |
| Diff sent up front | 200k characters (`agent-max-diff-size`); the single-shot fallback keeps `max-diff-size` (50k) so small-context models still fit |
| Tool calls per turn | 16 |
| Investigation time | 30 minutes |
| Output per tool call | about 50k characters (`read_file` returns up to 2000 lines and says where to continue) |
| `grep` | 300 matches, optional `context_lines` (0-5), files up to 2 MB, up to 100k files scanned |
| `list_files` | 2000 entries |
| Repository snapshot | 500 MB compressed |

When the turn or time limit runs out, Robin asks the model for its final review without
tools.

**Context compaction.** The diff and the tool output kept in the conversation share a
budget of about 450k characters (roughly 115-150k tokens). Tool output always gets at least
150k of it, so the larger the diff, the sooner compaction starts. Once tool output passes
its share, or whenever the provider reports that the context window is full, Robin compacts the conversation the way Cursor does. The model writes
notes about the investigation so far: suspected bugs with evidence, facts it established,
what it already checked, and what's left. Robin then continues from those notes plus the
latest tool turn. If the summary request itself fails, Robin falls back to dropping the
oldest tool results. A review can compact up to six times.

**Fallback.** If the model or provider rejects tool calling (for example OpenRouter's
"No endpoints found that support tool use", or Ollama's "does not support tools"), the
snapshot download fails, or the agent loop errors, Robin logs a warning and runs the
single-shot diff review instead, so the PR still gets a review. `/summary` is always
single-shot.

Agent mode sends more tokens than a single-shot review (the model reads extra files) and
takes longer. The reusable workflow's job timeout is 45 minutes to leave room for a full
investigation plus the final answer. Lower `agent-max-turns` if you want faster or cheaper
reviews. Set
`agent-mode: off` in `.github/robin.yml` to go back to diff-only reviews.

## Usage patterns

### Advisor mode (never block the PR)

Useful when Robin is an assistant and humans own merge decisions. Prefer `.github/robin.yml` for repo-wide defaults; use the workflow input to override per workflow:

```yaml
# .github/robin.yml
request-changes: false
```

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      request-changes: false   # boolean; omit this line to defer to .github/robin.yml
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

### Review on every commit

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      review-on-synchronize: true
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

### Manual review only

Useful for public repos with many forks (controls when the LLM runs):

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

### Direct action (full control in one file)

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'pull_request' ||
      (
        github.event_name == 'issue_comment' &&
        github.event.issue.pull_request &&
        contains(fromJSON('["OWNER", "MEMBER", "COLLABORATOR"]'), github.event.comment.author_association) &&
        (
          startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/review') ||
          startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/robin') ||
          startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/summary') ||
          startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/help')
        )
      )
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 45
    steps:
      - uses: antongulin/robin@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          llm-api-key: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
          llm-base-url: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
          model: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
          max-comments: "10"
```

### Strict mode (fail on high severity)

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      fail-on-high: true
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

If you raise `llm-timeout-ms` above 10 minutes, also raise the job `timeout-minutes`.

### Provider notes

Every provider is reached through the OpenAI chat-completions wire format. Robin
normalizes the base URL (trailing slash, a pasted `/chat/completions` or `/messages`
suffix, a missing `/v1` on the OpenAI and Anthropic hosts) and adjusts the request shape
for the hosts below. Self-hosted and proxy URLs are passed through unchanged.

| Provider | `LLM_BASE_URL` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `reasoning-effort` is sent as OpenAI-native `reasoning_effort`. Reasoning models (`o1`, `o3`, `o4-mini`, `gpt-5*`, `codex-*`) are sent without `temperature` and with `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`, because they reject both |
| Anthropic (Claude) | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1` | Uses Anthropic's [OpenAI SDK compatibility](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/openai-sdk) endpoint with your regular Anthropic API key (`LLM_API_KEY`). `https://api.anthropic.com` without `/v1` is accepted. Anthropic ignores `response_format`, so JSON mode relies on the prompt plus the markdown fallback parser, and it ignores reasoning controls — Robin sends none there and Claude picks its own thinking depth. `temperature` above `1` is capped by Anthropic |
| OpenRouter | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | `reasoning-effort` uses the OpenRouter `reasoning: { effort, exclude }` object; router models get stall detection and provider fallbacks |
| Anything else (Groq, Ollama, vLLM, gateways) | provider URL | Default request shape; unsupported parameters are recovered as described below |

### Models that reject request parameters

Newer models refuse parameters older ones accepted — OpenAI reasoning models return
`Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0.1 with this model` and
`Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' … Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead`. When a
400/422 response names one of the optional parameters Robin sent (`temperature`,
`max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `response_format`), Robin logs a warning, adjusts
that one parameter (omits `temperature`, switches `max_tokens` to
`max_completion_tokens`, drops the token cap or `response_format`), re-sends once, and
keeps the adjusted shape for the rest of the run. Each parameter is adjusted at most once
per run, so a provider that keeps rejecting surfaces its real error instead of looping.
Known OpenAI reasoning families skip the round trip and start with the right shape.

Dropping these is safe: the model falls back to its own default sampling, and the review
parser already handles non-JSON output. Auth, rate-limit, server, and unrelated
validation errors do not trigger this path.

### Models that require a fixed temperature

Robin samples at `0.1` so reviews stay near-deterministic. Some providers reject that and
accept only one value — Kimi models require `1`. Robin recovers automatically by
retrying without `temperature` (see above); set `llm-temperature` only when you want a
specific value sent rather than the model default:

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      llm-temperature: "1"
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

Accepted range is 0–2. Out-of-range or non-numeric values log a warning and fall back to
`0.1`. Raising temperature makes findings less repeatable, so change it only when the
provider requires it. Re-running the installer preserves this and any other `with:`
overrides in your workflow.

### Reasoning effort (provider-dependent)

Some providers and models accept a reasoning-effort control. Robin asks for `high` by
default: when `reasoning-effort` is unset or whitespace everywhere, the request carries
`high` in the provider's shape (below). Providers that do not understand the control reject
it and Robin falls back quietly (see the end of this section). To send no reasoning
configuration at all, set the value to `off`.

Set it per repository in `.github/robin.yml` — the normal location, because reasoning is
configuration, not a credential:

```yaml
# .github/robin.yml
reasoning-effort: high   # or low / medium / a provider-specific name, or off
```

The workflow input overrides the repo config when non-empty, so consumers can scope an
effort to a single caller:

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    with:
      reasoning-effort: "high"
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
```

Common values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`; exact names are provider-dependent (some
providers also use `minimal`, `xhigh`, or `max`). Robin forwards the trimmed value
unchanged. The request shape depends on the host in `LLM_BASE_URL`:

- `api.openai.com`: OpenAI-native `reasoning_effort: "<value>"`.
- `api.anthropic.com`: nothing is sent — Anthropic's compatibility endpoint ignores
  reasoning controls and Claude decides its own thinking depth. Robin logs this once.
- Everything else: OpenRouter-style `reasoning: { effort: "<value>", exclude: true }` —
  hidden reasoning is excluded from the response and never parsed; only the review text is
  used. Providers that expect a different native parameter reject it, and the fallback
  below then runs the review without reasoning controls.

If a provider rejects the parameter itself as unknown or unsupported, or clearly rejects
the configured effort value (a 400/422 response such as `Unsupported parameter: reasoning`
or `reasoning effort must be one of low, medium, high`), Robin logs a warning and retries
that completion once without the `reasoning` property. It then keeps running without a
reasoning override for the rest of the run. When the retry succeeds, the review completes
normally. If you set the value yourself (input or `.github/robin.yml`), the final status
comment also keeps a visible warning telling you to update `reasoning-effort`; when only
the `high` default was rejected, nothing is added to the PR — the fallback is recorded in
the Actions log only.

Auth, rate-limit, server, timeout, and unrelated validation errors do not trigger this
fallback. The retry omits the optional reasoning override; it does not guess a different
provider-specific effort value.

## Review flow

1. PR opened, reopened, or marked ready for review → automatic review.
2. Status comment appears, then updates when done.
3. Author pushes fixes → no automatic re-review (by default).
4. Maintainer comments `/robin` or `/review` for another pass.

The action fetches diffs and, in agent mode, a read-only tarball of the PR head through the GitHub API. `actions/checkout` is not required unless other steps need local files.

## Model robustness

Robin is built to give good reviews even when the LLM is a weak, free, or
randomly-routed model (e.g. OpenRouter's free tier). The prompt and parser do the
heavy lifting so the model doesn't have to. If you change `src/prompts/`, keep these
constraints in mind — they are why reviews stay usable across models:

- **Line-numbered diff.** The diff sent to the model is annotated with real new-file
  line numbers (`src/diff-annotate.ts`), and the prompt tells the model to copy those
  exact numbers. Weak models are bad at counting lines; handing them the numbers keeps
  inline comments anchored to the right place instead of drifting or being dropped.
- **Few-shot severity calibration.** The prompt includes worked HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/
  SUGGESTION examples plus an explicit rule: *impact ≠ confidence; never inflate
  severity*. Without calibration, weak models flag everything as HIGH. The examples
  pin the scale.
- **`confidence` field.** Each finding carries `high|medium|low` confidence separate
  from severity. The parser ignores invalid values, and the Robin skill uses confidence
  to decide how hard to verify a finding before acting on it. Severity orders effort;
  confidence gates trust.
- **"You only see the diff" guard.** The single-shot prompt reminds the model it sees
  changed lines only, not the whole file — so it doesn't invent bugs about code it can't
  see. The agent-mode prompt replaces this with "verify with the tools before flagging".
  The companion skill mirrors this: it treats findings as hypotheses to verify, not orders.
- **Graceful tool fallback.** Agent mode is only used when the model accepts tool calls;
  otherwise the same single-shot prompt runs, so weak or free models keep working.

The parser (`src/review-parser.ts`) is deliberately forgiving — it normalizes severity,
drops unparseable findings, and falls back to a markdown review if JSON mode fails — so a
malformed response from a weak model degrades instead of crashing the run.

## Security and privacy

PR diffs are sent to **your** configured LLM endpoint. In agent mode, any repository file the model reads with its tools is sent there too.

| Setup | Where code goes |
| --- | --- |
| Hosted API (OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, …) | That provider |
| Self-hosted Ollama | Your server |
| Self-hosted runner + local model | Your infrastructure |

Practices:

- Store keys in GitHub Secrets only.
- Use `permissions: actions: read`, `contents: read`, and `pull-requests: write`.
- Do not use `pull_request_target` with this action.
- Keep slash commands at `min-command-permission: write` unless you accept cost/abuse risk.
- Fork PRs from outsiders may not receive secrets — use manual `/review` from a maintainer.
- Agent-mode tools are read-only and confined to the extracted snapshot: paths and symlinks that resolve outside it are rejected, and PR code is never executed.

## Limits

No daily quota from this action. Real limits:

- GitHub Actions minutes (while the job waits on the model).
- Provider rate limits and model context size.
- `max-diff-size` truncation on very large PRs.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow can't resolve `@v0` | Wrong tag | Use `@main` |
| `Connection refused` | Runner can't reach LLM URL | Public URL, tunnel, or self-hosted runner |
| `Input required: model` | Missing secret | Add `LLM_MODEL` |
| `Input required: llm-base-url` | Missing secret | Add `LLM_BASE_URL` |
| `Empty response from LLM` | Free/unstable model returned no text | Action retries with backoff; comment `/review` again |
| `OpenRouter stall: no first response` | Auto-router hung before picking a provider | Action retries every 45s (up to 5×); PR status comment updates each attempt |
| Job cancelled / 45 min with no review | Hung LLM or concurrency cancel while waiting | Status comment should say interrupted — comment `/robin` again; pin `@v2.0.4`+ for stall detect |
| `404 Provider returned error` | OpenRouter free route missed one provider | Keep `LLM_MODEL=openrouter/free` — action retries (5×) with provider fallbacks; no secret updates when models rotate |
| `Request timed out` | Large PR or slow free model | Lower `max-diff-size` or raise `llm-timeout-ms` (router models default to 2 min per attempt) |
| `temperature` / `max_tokens` / `response_format` rejected | Newer model refuses an optional parameter (OpenAI reasoning models, Kimi) | Action warns, retries once without it (`max_tokens` → `max_completion_tokens`), and keeps that shape for the run; set `llm-temperature` only to pin a specific value (Kimi: `1`) |
| `404` on `https://api.anthropic.com` | Base URL missing `/v1` on an older Robin | Use `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`; `@v2`/`@main` normalize it automatically |
| `reasoning-effort` rejected as unsupported or invalid | Provider/model does not accept the reasoning control or configured value | The action warns and retries once with no reasoning override. If that succeeds, the review completes; a user-set value also gets a status-comment notice to update `.github/robin.yml` or the workflow `with:` block. Set `reasoning-effort: off` to stop sending it |
| `Resource not accessible by integration` | Missing permissions | Add `pull-requests: write` |
| Slash command ignored | Wrong format or permission | `/robin` or `/review` as first line; need write access |
| `/robin` does nothing on `@v1` | Stale `v1` tag before v1.4.0 | Use `/review`, pin `@v1.4.0`+, or `@v2`; floating `v1` tracks latest `1.x` on release |
| Shallow review | Small model or truncated diff | Stronger model or higher `max-diff-size` |

## Comparison

| Option | Best when |
| --- | --- |
| Robin | You want any model/provider and no SaaS lock-in |
| GitHub Copilot review | You already pay for Copilot |
| Hosted review bots | You want a managed product |
| Custom scripts | You want full control and will maintain it |

## Roadmap

- `.github/robin.yml` config file
- Provider presets
- Large PR chunking by file
- GitHub App install flow
